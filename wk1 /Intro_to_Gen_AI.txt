Week 1: Introduction to Generative AI
Day 1-2: Overview of AI and Generative AI
Lecture: Understanding AI and Its Evolution

Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, from simple rule-based systems to complex neural networks.

Generative AI: A subset of AI focused on creating new content—be it text, images, or sounds. Unlike traditional AI, which often classifies or predicts based on input data, generative AI produces novel outputs.

Key Concepts:

Machine Learning (ML): A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It’s a subset of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML involving neural networks with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain to solve complex data-driven problems.

Neural Networks: Systems of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

Activity: Discussion and Research

Discussion: What are some real-world applications of AI and generative AI? Examples include chatbots, recommendation systems, content creation tools, and more.

Research: Find and summarize an example of generative AI in action. Present your findings to the class.

Day 3-4: Introduction to Python Programming
Lecture: Python Fundamentals

Python Basics: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Key features include:

Data Types: Integer, float, string, list, tuple, dictionary, etc.

Variables: Containers for storing data values.

Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.
